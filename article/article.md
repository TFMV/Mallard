# Breaking Data Speed Limits: LetSQL, Arrow Flight & DuckDB in Action (And What Comes Next)

## TL;DR

- 240M+ rows/sec streaming throughput
- LetSQL abstracts Flight + Arrow + DataFusion for insane performance
- Rust-powered, but you don’t need to write Rust
- Streaming-native data pipelines will change ETL forever
- If you're moving large-scale data, you should pay attention to this pattern.

## Introduction

> Python is easy, but it is not simple.
> Go is simple, but it is not easy.
> Rust is… well, Rust is complicated.

I started coding young. Not just hacking together scripts—but really caring about how things worked.

I loved clean, performant code before I even knew what those words meant. It wasn’t about the language—it was about how efficiently I could make something run.

That mindset led me to Apache Arrow and Flight in Go—experimenting, testing, and pushing the limits of high-performance data streaming. Arrow-go is powerful, but as soon as you start working with Flight RPC, IPC streams, and real-time data exchange, you realize just how much heavy lifting happens behind the scenes.

The problem? I don’t know a lick of Rust.

LetSQL does.

LetSQL features a Rust-powered engine that brings together Arrow, DataFusion, and Flight, making advanced data streaming approachable. It abstracts away low-level complexity while enabling streaming-native data exchange at breakneck speeds.

And it’s fast.

Really fast.

## The Problem: Why Data Movement Is Still Hard

- Flight RPC is powerful, but complex
- Apache Arrow Flight is designed for high-performance data exchange, but using it efficiently still requires:
  - Optimizing batch sizes for throughput
  - Streaming efficiently to avoid bottlenecks
  - Handling schema evolution & serialization overhead
- ETL vs. Streaming: The Performance Bottleneck
  - Traditional ETL moves data in bulk, not streams → inefficient for real-time workloads.
A lot of modern architectures are still batch-first → streaming-native solutions aren't as widely adopted.
- Arrow-go vs. Rust-based solutions
  - Arrow-go is great, but Rust-based solutions (like LetSQL) are often better optimized for:
    - Memory safety (Rust's ownership model)
    - Multi-threading & concurrency (LetSQL taps into DataFusion's parallel query engine)
    - Better integration with DataFusion (native Rust ecosystem)

## The Solution: Experimentation That Paid Off

I built a LetSQL demo in 9 hours.

It achieved 240M rows/sec of streaming throughput.

This wasn’t just some random experiment—I wanted to see what was possible with Arrow Flight and a Rust-powered data movement engine.

```

### How It Works

Two DuckDB instances act as Flight servers.
Streaming data between them in real-time (leveraging Arrow Flight).
Custom Flight Exchanger (MyStreamingExchanger) → Allows inline transformations while streaming.

### What’s Inside

- LetSQL Flight Server → Built-in Flight server implementation.
- MyStreamingExchanger → Custom Flight exchanger for inline transformations.
- Flight Client → Simple Flight client implementation for testing.

### What LetSQL Does Differently

- Built-in Flight Server → No need to manually wire up Arrow Flight RPC.
- Seamless Arrow & DataFusion integration → Automatic batch processing optimization.
- Supports batch & streaming queries → No need to choose between ETL and real-time.
Instead of pulling & processing data in bulk, we move it at the speed of memory.

## The Results (Hold On Tight) 🚀

⚡ 240M+ Rows/Sec Streaming Throughput

- Flight do_exchange() achieves full-streaming throughput (no blocking bulk transfers).
- Real-world benchmark:
  - Sent: 24M records in 0.10 sec (236M rows/sec)
  - Received: 24M records in 0.40 sec (59M rows/sec)

⚡ Compared to Traditional Methods

| Method | Performance | Why It's Slower |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| CSV over HTTP | < 1M rows/sec | Text parsing overhead |
| Batch Parquet Copy | ~10M rows/sec | Disk I/O bottleneck |
| Arrow Flight GET | 50-60M rows/sec | Pull-based, but no inline transforms |
| Flight Exchange (LetSQL) | 240M+ rows/sec 🚀 | True streaming, inline processing |

> We’re no longer talking about incremental performance gains. This is a paradigm shift in how we move data.

## The Future: Where This Pattern Is Going

Instead of manually defining Flight servers, what if you could declare them like this?

```python
@flight_ops(do_get=True, do_exchange=True)
def my_expr():
    return duckdb.sql("SELECT * FROM flights")

expr.into_flight(name="flights")  # Automatically spins up Flight server
```

This keeps @flight_ops focused on defining Flight capabilities, while into_flight() actually spins up the server.

## 🚀 Chained Flight Servers (Distributed Query Engines)

Hussain Sultan (LetSQL) hinted at the future:

- Chaining multiple Flight servers into a processing pipeline, with each Flight instance handling different transformations.
- Think of it like distributed SQL, but for streaming queries → instead of pulling from a database, queries flow across multiple Flight-powered processing nodes.
- The LetSQL team is actively working on this, and it could redefine how we handle high-velocity data.

---

## 💡 What This Means for the Industry

- ETL as we know it will change → streaming-native data pipelines will outperform batch-based architectures.
- Flight will become the backbone of modern data movement → its efficiency scales better than traditional REST APIs or bulk load operations.
- The industry is heading towards declarative streaming workflows → LetSQL might be the first glimpse of that future.

## Final Thoughts: Why This Matters

This wasn’t just an experiment—this is a preview of what’s coming next in data engineering.

- LetSQL, Arrow Flight, and DuckDB are unlocking streaming-native data pipelines.
- 240M+ rows/sec isn’t theoretical—it’s achievable today.
- Flight-based architectures could replace traditional batch ETL in many cases.

> This was fun to build, and I’m excited to see where LetSQL and the broader data community take this next.
